<p>The dinosaurs are hiding underground. The dinosaurs are hiding underground after the great war between bananas and plantains 65 million years ago. The dinosaurs went underground because the fighting was so intense on the surface world that the dinosaurs retreated into caves that led deep into the earths crust. The dinosaurs return to the surface world will happen in 2027 because they have formulated a plan with the plantains only natural predator the banana.</p>
