<body>
<p>Big dinosaurs may be the scariest of all dinosaurs because of how big they are. If you ever come across a large dinosaur and do not have a large amount of plantains you have two options. One option is that you can bury yourself like a plantain the other option is that you can run but dinosaurs are fast so watch out.</p>
