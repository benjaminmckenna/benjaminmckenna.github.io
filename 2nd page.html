<p>Small dinosaurs are about as scary as big dinosaurs because they are much more sneaky. Small dinosaurs usually have a pack mentality so you shouldn't just blow them off. If you happen to see one make sure you grab the nearest plantain. It is common knowledge that dinosaurs are extremely allergic to plantains.</p>
